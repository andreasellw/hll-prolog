### Individual contributions

Due too the small group size of 3 it is impossible for us to properly distinguish what of our project has been done by whom. We all worked on all parts of our application, especially since we mostly did “pair-programming” (with two or often all three of us working together). So all of us were equally involved in all parts of our application.
We would be happy to answer questions about our development process, aswell as our individual/colletive contributions at the examination.
